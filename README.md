# Keylogger  
This project is a Python-based keylogger designed to demonstrate how keystrokes can be captured in a controlled environment. It is intended for educational purposes only.  

## Features  
- Captures user keystrokes in real time.  
- Logs keystrokes to a file (`keylog.txt`).  

## How to Use  
1. Install the required library:  
   ```bash
   pip install pynput
# Run the script:

python keylogger.py

Keystrokes will be logged to the keylog.txt file in the same directory.
